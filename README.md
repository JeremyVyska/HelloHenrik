## HelloHenrik

This silly little repo was made with Hugo during a Live Stream, which is available here:

[Blogging with Hugo and GitHub](https://youtu.be/mI3cI-BhCyg)


The Resources mentioned include:

* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

I was loosely following this guide for reference:

[Create and host a blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages in less than 30 minutes](https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-gh/)

We used the [DoIt](https://hugodoit.pages.dev/) theme in the stream (Do It, even though I laughed because it looks like 'DOLT'):

In this repo, you'll see there is an Action that I used in the stream which you are welcome to copy.

It's available [here](https://github.dev/JeremyVyska/HelloHenrik/blob/4766a9c8e786f7357c60fb8618db5210409f1cc0/.github/workflows/build-hugo.yml).
